# SreTool

Welcome to your new gem! In this directory, you'll find the files you need to be able to package up your Ruby library into a gem. Put your Ruby code in the file `lib/sre_tool`. To experiment with that code, run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt.

TODO: Delete this and the text above, and describe your gem

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'sre_tool'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install sre_tool

## Usage

TODO: Write usage instructions here

## Assumptions

The versions of gems should be pinned down in sre_tool.gemspec, but it isn't critical for this use case.
